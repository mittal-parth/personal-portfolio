## Using as a theme ‚ú®

### Code changes

Three main things have to be changed to customize it your way (please open an issue if you find more such instances):

1. Personal Information

- [/src/constants/index.js](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/src/constants/index.js) contains all the personal information one needs to change. Each website section is written as a JavaScript object and is pretty intuitive to change.

- Icons
  - Whenever you want to use an icon, you'll have to make sure that the icon is imported.
  - Head to [https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search) and search for the desired icon. (Eg: SiReact for ReactJS)
  - Note the package it belongs to (Eg: 'Si' here)
  - Import the icon into [`/src/constants/index.js`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/src/constants/index.js) (Eg: `import { ... SiReact, } from "react-icons/si";` here)

2. Website title and icon

- Go to [`index.html`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/index.html) and change the [`title`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/index.html#L7") to your name.
- Also, change the link to the title [icon](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/index.html#L5)

3. Assets

- Add any assets (images) to the [`assets`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/tree/main/src/assets) folder.
- Import the asset and export it using the[`/src/assets/index.js`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/index.js) file.

### Deployment

You can use [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/) to deploy your site. Follow the instructions in their docs to do so.

## Sample Git Workflow

- Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/readme.md#installation-guide) to install the software
- Create a new feature branch with `git checkout -b <name-of-your-feature-branch>`
- Make changes and commit them in the feature branch.
- Once done developing, switch back to the main branch with `git checkout main` ; pull the latest version of the repo with `git pull https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio.git main`
- Switch back to the feature branch with `git checkout <name-of-your-feature-branch>`. Apply the new changes on top of the latest version of the repo with `git rebase main`
- [Resolve merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/) (if any)
- Push your feature branch upto your remote repo with `git push origin <name-of-your-feature-branch>`
- [Submit a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) to the main branch.
- After any questions or changes have been resolved, your contribution would be merged in!
