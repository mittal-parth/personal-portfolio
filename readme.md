## Using as a theme ‚ú®

### Code changes

Three main things have to be changed to customize it your way (please open an issue if you find more such instances):

1. Personal Information

- [/src/constants/index.js](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/src/constants/index.js) contains all the personal information one needs to change. Each website section is written as a JavaScript object and is pretty intuitive to change.

- Icons
  - Whenever you want to use an icon, you'll have to make sure that the icon is imported.
  - Head to [https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search) and search for the desired icon. (Eg: SiReact for ReactJS)
  - Note the package it belongs to (Eg: 'Si' here)
  - Import the icon into [`/src/constants/index.js`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/src/constants/index.js) (Eg: `import { ... SiReact, } from "react-icons/si";` here)

2. Website title and icon

- Go to [`index.html`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/index.html) and change the [`title`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/index.html#L7") to your name.
- Also, change the link to the title [icon](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/index.html#L5)

3. Assets

- Add any assets (images) to the [`assets`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/tree/main/src/assets) folder.
- Import the asset and export it using the[`/src/assets/index.js`](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/index.js) file.

4. Creating a .env file

    > Environment variables store sensitive information that vary for the user and should not be checked into source control.
    > One such example is the GitHub personal access token to automatically fetch the Open Source Contributions.

- A personal access token (classic) can be created to use the GitHub API following the official guide from GitHub - [GitHub Docs - Creating  personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic). Giving it repo:status, public_repo, read:project, read:org scopes is sufficient.
- Create a file called `.env` in the root project folder
- Copy over the contents of the `.env.example` example file into the `.env` file.
- Replace the value of the environment variable value(s) with the values you want the environment variables to hold, for e.g. `VITE_GH_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` where `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` is the personal access token you generated earlier.



### Deployment

You can use [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/) to deploy your site. Follow the instructions in their docs to do so.

Since we have env variables, make sure to add them from the Netlify UI as well. [Link to Guide](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#site-environment-variables)

The checkbox for 'Contains secret values' can be checked.

- Please read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md);
our community aspires to be a respectful place both during online and in-person interactions.
- Please follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/readme.md#installation-guide) and the [sample git workflow](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/readme.md#sample-git-workflow) to contribute.

## Installation Guide üßë‚Äçüíª

### Using Git and Github

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo
- [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork) the forked repository
- Enter the new `portfolio` directory with `cd portfolio`
- Set the upstream remote to the original repository url so that git knows where to fetch updates from in future: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio.git`

### Install required packages

- `npm install`

### Environment Variables

- Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root project folder and add the environment variables to it as outlined in the [Code changes](#code-changes) section, 4th point.

### Run server

- `npx netlify dev`

<br/>

## Sample Git Workflow

- Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio/blob/main/readme.md#installation-guide) to install the software
- Create a new feature branch with `git checkout -b <name-of-your-feature-branch>`
- Make changes and commit them in the feature branch.
- Once done developing, switch back to the main branch with `git checkout main` ; pull the latest version of the repo with `git pull https://github.com/mittal-parth/personal-portfolio.git main`
- Switch back to the feature branch with `git checkout <name-of-your-feature-branch>`. Apply the new changes on top of the latest version of the repo with `git rebase main`
- [Resolve merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/) (if any)
- Push your feature branch upto your remote repo with `git push origin <name-of-your-feature-branch>`
- [Submit a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) to the main branch.
- After any questions or changes have been resolved, your contribution would be merged in!
